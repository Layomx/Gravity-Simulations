# Gravity-Simulations
![alt text](https://gereshes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/8by7.png)
Different gravity simulations I did mostly for fun and skills improvement, I'm combining two fields I like with this, programming and physics. 

This topic is very interesting, because gravity is one of the four forces of nature and many things happen due to this force and the humanity has been studying it since the beginning of physics, my objective is to learn how to simulate this with research, other repositories and... Searching with google basically, I'm still a beginner in programming, I don't have many personal projects but I'm willing to make this one a big project. 

I have many objetives with this project, but the most important is to learn how programming works, testing different technologies, and improve the project with different parts, my plan is that every new part will have improvements, new physic effects and be better overall. I'm starting with C/C++ because is the language I know the most but I'll try with Python and other tech I'm trying to learn. The first part was made with SFML and C++ (using a simple struct), to try the program and the code you will need to install SFML and copy the dll archives, I'm curious what I will be using next. 3/10/2025
